# Client-Blog-Assignment

The project was to interview my client to obtain information for styling and content preference.

Necessary content-folder items:
1. Name of Blog 
2. Title of blog post 
3. 2 colors you want used (white/black/gray are options) 
4. 2 fonts from google 

This assignment allowed me to get better at compiling my index.html, styles.css and an images for my content folder. 

Instead of utilizing lorem ipsum for the paragraph text, I actually interviewed the client and obtained information on her passion and vision. 

The images used came from pixabay.com and were the smallest download size. 

The background image used for the body of the site was downloaded from subtlepatterns.com. 

All necessary HTML tags and link to an external style sheet is present.

This project met the minimum requirements: 2 images, 2 fonts, 2 different hex code colors, a background image, 2 buttons.

The overall goal was to create, based on someone else's vision. The difficult part was taking the vision of the client, meshing it with my vision and bringing it to life in a way that allows the client to feel satisfied.
